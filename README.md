# Re-Climate

WeatherLogistics' Re-ClimateÂ® product supplies reliable seasonal climate forecasts to prepare for extended weather hazards.

The API provides access to four main data streams:

1. Monthly Centiles

ASCII formatted grid of precipitation in addition to minimum, maximum and average monthly temperatures. At present these are available for the United Kingdom, Spain and Turkey. They present the lower to upper thresholds in the respectively meteorological variables at the 10th, 30th, median (50th), 70th and 90th centiles. Since the seasonal climate forecasts provide well-calibrated information, 8 in 10 months are likely to present monthly conditions between the 10th and 90th centiles at any specified geographical location.
