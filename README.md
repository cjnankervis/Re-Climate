# Re-Climate

WeatherLogistics' Re-ClimateÂ® product supplies reliable seasonal climate forecasts to prepare for extended weather hazards.

The API provides access to four main data streams:

1. Monthly Centiles

Country-wide ASCII grid provided at a monthly granularity, useful for a country-wide overview

Monthly centile data supplies users with mapped averages of precipitation in addition to minimum, maximum and average monthly temperatures. At present these are available for the United Kingdom, Spain and Turkey. They present the lower to upper thresholds in the respectively meteorological variables at the 10th, 30th, median (50th), 70th and 90th centiles. Since the seasonal climate forecasts provide well-calibrated information, 8 in 10 months are likely to present monthly conditions between the 10th and 90th centiles at any specified geographical location.

2. Daily Ensembles

Unique access to 100 daily simulations at the town/ city scale, ideal for those with assets at specified locations

Our daily ensembles provide the opportunity to calculate reliable frequencies of occurence, intensity thresholds and accumulations using our example Python scripts to generate customised metrics.


3. Hazard Indices



4. Anomaly
