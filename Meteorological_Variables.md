### Hazard Indices

Hazard Indices or 'Scores' are generated by comparing forecasts against a 15-year climatology dataset derived from the [UERRA MESCAN-SURFEX](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-uerra-europe-single-levels?tab=overview) 4.5km reanalysis product. Documentation and further information is available from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS).**

Both the daily ensemble weather forecast data and observations are statistically processed to generate confidence intervals at each decile (10th, 20th, 30th, 40th, 50th, 60th, 70th, 80th, 90th, 100th). An index units of 5.0 indicates a forecast that is on par with the historical measurements (from UERRA reanalysis) spanning the years 2004 to 2018. A shift of one decile category unit in the seasonal climate forecast increases the likelihood of more extreme weather, and increases the hazard index by one unit.

**"hail"** <ins>Hail Indices</ins> are calculated by comparing the 80th centile of ensemble forecasts of aggregated ERA-5 derived convective precipitation rate (hail)/ H80 against closely spatially matched measurements of daily precipitation rates from recent history. Index values of 1 indicate that the likelihood of intense convective precipitation is low, while an index of 9 indicate that hail or intense precippitation events are more likely within the seasonal period (potentially crop, building or other infrastructure/ asset damage). **Compared against Copernicus ERA-5 observations/ WeatherLogistics' model climatology.

**"solar"** <ins>Solar Indices</ins> are calculated by comparing the 20th centile of ensemble forecasts of ERA-5 derived aggregated daily average solar radiation (solar)/ S80 against closely spatially matched measurements of solar radiation from recent history. Index values of 1 indicate that the likelihood of extreme cloudless days is low, while an index of 9 indicate that the extreme sunlight exposure is more likely within the seasonal period (potentially exacerbating drought or heat-stress if combined with high temperatures). **Compared against Copernicus ERA-5 observations/ WeatherLogistics' model climatology.

**"wind"** <ins>Wind Indices</ins> are calculated by comparing the 80th centile of ensemble forecasts of ERA-5 derived aggregated daily average wind speed (wind) / RH80 against closely spatially matched measurements of relative humidity conditions from recent history. Index values of 1 indicate that the likelihood of extreme windy days is low, while an index of 9 indicate that high winds are more likely within the seasonal period (potentially leading to crop lodging, or building or other infrastructure/ asset damage). **Compared against Copernicus ERA-5 observations/ WeatherLogistics' model climatology.

**"aridity"** <ins>Aridity Indices</ins> are calculated by comparing the 20th centile of ensemble forecasts of ERA-5 derived aggregated daily minimum and maximum relative humidity/ RH20 against closely spatially matched measurements of relative humidity from recent history. Index values of 1 indicate that the likelihood of extreme aridity is low, while an index of 9 indicate that the extreme aridity is more likely within the seasonal period (potentially to agricultural soil moisuture deficits, or exacerbation of drought conditions if combined with high temperatures and/ or low precipitation). **Compared against Copernicus ERA-5 observations/ WeatherLogistics' model climatology.

**"cold"** <ins>Cold Indices</ins> are calculated by comparing the 20th centile of ensemble forecasts of 24-hour minimum daily temperatures (tmin)/ TMIN20 against closely spatially matched measurements of hydrological conditions from recent history. Index values of 1 indicate that the likelihood of extreme colder-than-average daytime minimum temperatures is low, while an index of 9 indicate that the extreme cold nighttime weather is more likely within the seasonal period (potentially frost or crop damage).

**"drought"** <ins>Drought Indices</ins> are calculated by comparing the 20th centile of ensemble forecasts of dry days/ PR20 (where preciptation exceeds 0.1 milimetres per day) against closely spatially matched measurements of drought conditions from recent history. The minimum threshold of 0.1mm avoids multiple decile probability of occurence categories of zero precipitation, which is commonplace in arid climates. Index values of 1 indicate that the likelihood of extreme drier-than-average conditions is low, while an index of 9 indicate that that extreme drought is more likely within the seasonal period (potentially water shortages linked to crop failiure and domestic water supply and quality issues).

**"heat"** <ins>Heat Indices</ins> are calculated by comparing the 80th centile of ensemble forecasts of 24-hour maximum daily temperatures (tmax)/ TMAX80 against closely spatially matched measurements of hydrological conditions from recent history. Index values of 1 indicate that the likelihood of extreme warmer-than-average daytime maximum temperatures is low, while an index of 9 indicate that the extreme daytime heat is more likely within the seasonal period (potentially overheating of buildings if during the summer or warmer seasons).

**"humidity"** <ins>Humidity Indices</ins> are calculated by comparing the 80th centile of ensemble forecasts of ERA-5 derived aggregated daily minimum and maximum relative humidity/ RH80 against closely spatially matched measurements of relative humidity conditions from recent history. Index values of 1 indicate that the likelihood of extreme humidity is low, while an index of 9 indicate that the extreme daytime humidity levels are more likely within the seasonal period (potentially linked to crop pests/ disease or heat-stress if combined with high temperatures). **Compared against Copernicus ERA-5 observations/ WeatherLogistics' model climatology.

**"precipitation"** <ins>Flood Scores</ins> are calculated by comparing the 80th centile of ensemble forecasts of wet days/ PR80 (where preciptation exceeds 1.0mm per day) against closely spatially matched measurements of hydrological conditions from recent history. Index values of 1 indicate that the likelihood of extreme wetter-than-average conditions from heavier downpours is low, while an index of 9 indicate that that extreme precipitation (potentially flash flooding) is more likely within the seasonal period.

**"spi"** <ins>SPI</ins> (Standard Precipitation Index) is calculated by comparing the 50th centile of ensemble forecasts of non-drizzle days/ PR50 (where precipitation exceeds 0.3 milmetres per day) against closely spatially matched measurements of hydrological conditions obtained from recent history. The minimum threshold of 0.3mm is a calibrated value to account for less reliable observations of lighter precipitation events. Index values of 1 indicate that the likelihood of an overall wetter-than-average season is low, while an index of 9 indicate that excess precipitation (potentially leading to groundwater flooding or extended wet periods) is more likely during the seasonal period.
