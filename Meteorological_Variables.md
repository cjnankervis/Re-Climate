## Meteorological Variable Definitions

### All Products Except Hazard Indices and Graphical Summaries

**"tmin"** 24-hour (average) minimum of 2-metre temperature in degrees Celsius (°C) spatially averaged over the native grid area (5 kilometres)

**"tmax"** 24-hour (average) maximum of 2-metre temperature in degrees Celsius (°C) spatially averaged over the native grid area (5 kilometres)

**"precipitation"** 24-hour (OR monthly for "monthly-centiles" and "anomaly" products) accumulation of precipitation of all types in milimetres (mm) spatially averaged over the native grid area (5 kilometres)

**"minhumidity"** 24-hour minimum relative humidity at 2-metres above the surface as a percentage of saturation point (%), spatally average over the native grid area (5 kilometres)

**"maxhumidity"** 24-hour minimum relative humidity at 2-metres above the surface as a percentage of saturation point (%), spatally average over the native grid area (5 kilometres)

**"hail"** 24-hour average of precipitation rate or intensity in milimetres per second multiplied by 1000 (mm/s x 1000), spatally average over the native grid area (5 kilometres)

**"wind"** 24-hour average of wind speed at 10 metres above the surface in metres per second (m/s), spatally average over the native grid area (5 kilometres)

**"solar"** 24-hour average of incoming solar radiation at the surface in Watts per metre squared (W/m<sup>2</sup> (daily mean)), spatally average over the native grid area (5 kilometres)
