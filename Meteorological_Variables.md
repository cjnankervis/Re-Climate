## Meteorological Variable Definitions

### All Products Except Hazard Indices and Graphical Summaries

**"tmin"** 24-hour (average) minimum of 2-metre temperature in degrees Celsius (°C) spatially averaged over the native grid area (5 kilometres)

**"tmax"** 24-hour (average) maximum of 2-metre temperature in degrees Celsius (°C) spatially averaged over the native grid area (5 kilometres)

**"precipitation"** 24-hour (OR monthly for "monthly-centiles" and "anomaly" products) accumulation of precipitation of all types in milimetres (mm) spatially averaged over the native grid area (5 kilometres)

**"minhumidity"** 24-hour minimum relative humidity at 2-metres above the surface as a percentage of saturation point (%), spatally average over the native grid area (5 kilometres)

**"maxhumidity"** 24-hour minimum relative humidity at 2-metres above the surface as a percentage of saturation point (%), spatally average over the native grid area (5 kilometres)

**"hail"** 24-hour average of precipitation rate or intensity in milimetres per second multiplied by 1000 (mm/s x 1000), spatally average over the native grid area (5 kilometres)

**"wind"** 24-hour average of wind speed at 10 metres above the surface in metres per second (m/s), spatally average over the native grid area (5 kilometres)

**"solar"** 24-hour average of incoming solar radiation at the surface in Watts per metre squared (W/m<sup>2</sup> (daily mean)), spatally average over the native grid area (5 kilometres)

### Hazard Indices

Hazard Indices or 'Scores' are generated by comparing forecasts against a 15-year climatology dataset derived from the [UERRA MESCAN-SURFEX](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-uerra-europe-single-levels?tab=overview) 4.5km reanalysis product. Documentation and further information is available from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS).

Both the daily ensemble weather forecast data and observations are statistically processed to generate confidence intervals at each decile (10th, 20th, 30th, 40th, 50th, 60th, 70th, 80th, 90th, 100th). An index units of 5.0 indicates a forecast that is on par with the historical measurements (from UERRA reanalysis) spanning the years 2004 to 2018. A shift of one decile category unit in the seasonal climate forecast increases the likelihood of more extreme weather, and increases the hazard index by one unit.

**"hail"**

**"solar"**

**"wind"**

**"aridity"**

**"cold"**

**"drought"** <ins>Drought Indices</ins> are calculated by comparing the 20th centile of all non-drizzle days/ PR20 (where preciptation exceeds 0.1mm per day) with closely matched spatial measurements of weather conditions from recent history. The minimum threshold of 0.1mm avoids multiple decile probability of occurence categories of zero precipitation, which is commonplace in arid climates.

**"heat"**

**"humidity"**

**"precipitation"** <ins>Flood Scores</ins> are calculated by comparing the 80th centile of predicted wet days/ PR80 (where preciptation exceeds 1.0mm per day) with closely matched spatial measurements of weather conditions from recent history.
